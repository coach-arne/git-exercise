# Setup
In this first exercise we'll setup a new git repository. Open the command
line and navigate to a newly created folder. Give it a name you want, for
example `git-exercise`.

In the folder create a new git project with

`git init`

After initializing the git repository go onto `github` or `bitbucket`
and create a new project. Do not clone the repository, add the `remote
origin` manually through git commands.

Now that you added the remote origin, create a `development` branch on
which you will be working. Checkout the branch and add your first file
named `introduction.txt`. You can edit the file through command line
or open a text editor like `Visual Studio` or `Sublime Text`.

Add the file to the versioned items, and make your first `commit` and
`push` it to the remote `development` branch.
