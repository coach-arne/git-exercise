# Chapter I
Create a `feature branch` and add the first chapter to a new file called
`chapter-i.txt`

Paste the following content in the file:
https://gist.github.com/coach-arne/ab73c357240e7ea5fa902b5de2f4cb16

Commit the file to the feature branch, merge the feature branch into the
development branch, create a `release branch` called v1, `merge` development
in the release branch, after that `merge` release branch with the master branch
and `tag` the current state of the project as v1.
