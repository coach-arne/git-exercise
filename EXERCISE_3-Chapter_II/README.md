# Chapter II
Create a `feature branch` and add the first chapter to a new file called
`chapter-ii.txt`

Paste the following content in the file:
https://gist.github.com/coach-arne/ff90807cfafa15993742dcd0e7d2790a

Commit the file to the feature branch, merge the feature branch into the
development branch, create a `release branch` called v2, `merge` development
in the release branch, after that `merge` release branch with the master branch
and `tag` the current state of the project as v2.
